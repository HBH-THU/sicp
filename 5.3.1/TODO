* 5.21, 5.22: reimplement in terms of vector-ref and vector-set!.

* I suspect that car, cdr, cons, etc. need to be implemented in terms
  of vector-ref and vector-set!.  Without which, we may have missed
  the whole point of this section.

* 5.21: taking null?, pair? etc. as primitive per our conversation
  with sreeram on 8 August, 2007:

  Though the low-level discussion of the type system would seem to
  imply that we should implement our own as an implicit sub-exercise.
