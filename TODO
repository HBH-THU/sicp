* In addition to section-specific TODOs, we need tests for 1.1.7 -
  3.3.4.

* Replace recursive loads with content.scm + monkey-patches; or even
  the bona fide package-system.

  Alternatively: the long-overdue caching load, which refuses to
  reload based on the global file-table; and evaluates each file, say,
  in (the-environment).

* By analogy with 4.4.4, institute "contexts" which segregate source
  and exercises?

  [0-9]*.scm, context.scm and src/, for instance.
