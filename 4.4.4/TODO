* In addition to section-specific TODOs, we need tests for 1.1.7 -
  3.3.4.

* Replace recursive loads with content.scm + monkey-patches; or even
  the bona fide package-system.

  Alternatively: the long-overdue caching load, which refuses to
  reload based on the global file-table; and evaluates each file, say,
  in (the-environment).

* 4.67: actually implement the loop-detector

* 4.68: (reverse ?x (3 2 1)) goes into an infinite loop; see
