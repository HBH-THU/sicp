* Because of the post-hoc creation of 4.4.4, certain simlinks that
  point to 4.4.3 imply that the files originate thence.

  Move the 4.4.4-specific files to 4.4.4 from 4.4.3.

* 4.71 is defective; pg. 478? 3.5.4 solve?  See pg. 470: the
  assertions are applied, the rules delayed; is it possible to apply
  rules before the assertions are populated?

  Clue: apply-rules is called before find-assertions in the modified
  version of simple-query; in the unmodified version, vice versa.

* 4.72 is defective.

* 4.73 is defective.

* 4.74b is defective (whether system's behaviour changes with
  simple-flatten).

* 4.75: unique-wizard has an artifactual embedded list.

* 4.77: delayed filtering implemented for not; TODO: lisp-value.

* 4.78: pattern matching works; TODO: implement rules.

* 4.79: environment-based query works; TODO: rule-analog of
  block-structured procedures.
