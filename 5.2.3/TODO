* make-new-machine, etc.: fold the results of 5.9, 5.11c and 5.12 back
  into the machine; come up with a register-machine-tests suite.

* 5.10: syntax change pervasive enough?

* 5.11a: appears to be redundant with 5.6 (though that's two
  instructions); a brute-force removal didn't work.

  Something clever we're missing?
